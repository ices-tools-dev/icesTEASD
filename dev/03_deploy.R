# Building a Prod-Ready, Robust Shiny Application.
#
# README: each step of the dev files is optional, and you don't have to
# fill every dev scripts before getting started.
# 01_start.R should be filled at start.
# 02_dev.R should be used to keep track of your development during the project.
# 03_deploy.R should be used once you need to deploy your app.

# Test your app

## Run checks ----
## Check the package before sending to prod
devtools::check()

# Deploy

# we deploy only through github actions, and when code is changed on the main
# branch :)

# update renv.lock file
# important to have icesTEASD installed so that another machine can find it

## Local, CRAN or Package Manager ----
## This will build a tar.gz that can be installed locally,
## sent to CRAN, or to a package manager
#devtools::build()

## RStudio ----
## If you want to deploy on RStudio related platforms
golem::add_shinyappsio_file()

# Deploy to Posit Connect or ShinyApps.io
